Utilize your Matic Mike NFT & dance your way to victory earning and burning plenty of $HGH along the way. The Dance Royale contract is the newest addition to the matic mike family. It makes heavy utilization of Chainlink and provides plenty of analytics integrated within the contract for our users to enjoy. A rolling queue system, the Dance Royale allows up to 50 people to join with 1 $HGH and the ability to add additional power level to their Matic Mike by injecting with up to 5 $HGH. The winner received 70% of hte pot, 2nd place 20% and third 10%. No $HGH is pocketed, any "juiced up" $HGH is burned.
